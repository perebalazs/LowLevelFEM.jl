# LowLevelFEM

LowLevelFEM is a Julia package for finite element analysis with an engineering-first workflow. It exposes each phase of the workflow as simple functions (mesh → matrices → loads/BCs → solve → postprocess → visualize), so you can customize, combine, or inspect any step. Typical tasks such as strain energy or resultants are one-liners (for example, `U = q' * K * q / 2`).

## Capabilities

- Geometry and meshing: integrates with `gmsh` for 2D/3D geometry, meshing, and physical groups.
- Problem types: 3D solids, 2D plane stress/plane strain, axisymmetric; 3D/2D heat conduction and axisymmetric heat conduction.
- Elements and order: standard line/triangle/quad/tetra/hex/pyramid/wedge with Lagrange order up to 10.
- Materials: linear elastic (Hooke) and large deformation laws (St. Venant–Kirchhoff, compressible Neo-Hooke).
- Matrices: stiffness `K`, mass `M` (lumped or consistent), proportional damping `C` (Rayleigh/Caughey), heat conduction/capacity, latent heat, and convection matrices/vectors.
- Loads and constraints: nodal and distributed loads on physical groups; function-based loads and temperature BCs; elastic supports; initial displacement/velocity/temperature.
- Thermal–structural coupling: thermal expansion, thermal stresses, and heat generated by elastic deformation.
- Solvers: static and transient dynamics (central difference and HHT-α from the Newmark family).
- Eigenproblems: modal analysis (frequencies and mode shapes, optionally prestressed) and linear buckling (critical factors and modes).
- Field operators and results: gradient/divergence/curl; stress/strain and heat flux as element or nodal fields; smoothing at nodes with field jumps; user-defined scalar/vector/tensor FE fields.
- Visualization and plots: Gmsh-based views for displacements, stresses, strains, heat flux, with animation for dynamics; plot results along user-defined paths; show results on surfaces.
- Coordinate systems: rotate nodal DOFs with constant or function-defined local coordinate systems (incl. curvilinear).

## Installation

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("LowLevelFEM")
```

## Quick Start

```julia
using LowLevelFEM
import LowLevelFEM as FEM

gmsh.initialize()
gmsh.open("your_model.geo")

mat = FEM.material("body", E=2e5, ν=0.3)
prob = FEM.Problem([mat], type=:PlaneStress)  # :Solid, :PlaneStrain, :AxiSymmetric, :HeatConduction, ...

bc   = FEM.displacementConstraint("supp", ux=0, uy=0)
load = FEM.load("load", fy=-1)

q = FEM.solveDisplacement(prob, [load], [bc])
S = FEM.solveStress(prob, q)

FEM.showDoFResults(prob, q, :uvec)
FEM.showStressResults(prob, S, :s, smooth=true)

gmsh.fltk.run()
gmsh.finalize()
```

More end-to-end examples are available under `examples/` and in the documentation.
