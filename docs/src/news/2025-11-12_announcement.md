# November 2025 – Package Announcement

We are happy to announce that **LowLevelFEM.jl** is now officially available in the Julia General Registry! 🎉

The package provides a lightweight and transparent FEM environment written entirely in Julia.  
It supports:

- 2D and 3D solid mechanics (plane stress/strain, axisymmetric, and full 3D)
- Heat conduction and thermo-mechanical coupling
- Gmsh integration for pre- and post-processing

Unlike symbolic DSL-based FEM frameworks, LowLevelFEM gives you full control over assembly, boundary conditions, and solution steps — ideal for teaching, research, and method development.
